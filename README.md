# Deepdive into ML Algorithms

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository is a comprehensive guide to understanding various machine learning algorithms. It covers the fundamental concepts, mathematical intuition, and practical implementations of key algorithms used in data science and AI.

## ðŸ“– Topics Covered

### ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing data
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling (Standardization & Normalization)
- Splitting dataset into training & testing sets

### ðŸ”¹ Model Evaluation & Optimization
- Performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- Cross-validation techniques
- Hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search & Random Search)

## ðŸ›  Installation & Setup
To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/understanding-machine-learning-algorithms.git
cd understanding-machine-learning-algorithms

# Create a virtual environment (Optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸš€ How to Use
Each algorithm has its own dedicated folder with:
- Jupyter Notebooks explaining the concept
- Python scripts for implementation
- Sample datasets for testing
